üßê¬†The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) is an alliance of 11 states located in a geographical area prone to tropical storms, volcanic eruptions and other natural hazards related to climate change. It is therefore important for local and regional authorities to be able to rapidly locate schools and to be able to assess whether schools are damaged by different hazards.

üéØ¬†The aim of the challenge is to create a digital platform to help communities locate the nearest schools in their districts and, in case of an emergency, to identify community facilities that can provide shelter or first aid kits.

‚õë¬†To prepare for this challenge, we are looking for people who are comfortable with web development, geolocation and creating optimised routes.

# Data

The information available for this challenge comes from Saint Lucia, in the Caribbean, off the coast of Venezuela. It contains information on roads, schools, elevation, and admnistrative boundaries. For ease of all participants, all this information has been saved on a [GeoPackage](https://box.iiep.unesco.org/s/qH3Z9aBtjCddJ95). The table below includes information on the different sources of information used to construct this file. 

|Variable|Source|Additional information|
|:----|:----|:----|
|Administrative boundaries|[HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-lca)|File name: lca_admbnda_gov_2019_SHP.zipSHP|
|Digital Elevation Model|[Copernicus GLO-30 Digital Elevation Model](https://portal.opentopography.org/raster?opentopoID=OTSDEM.032021.4326.3)|Information for Saint Lucia obtained on the 2nd of May, 2022|
|Road network|[HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_lca_roads)|File name: hotosm_lca_roads_lines_shp.zip|
|School location|[OECS](https://box.iiep.unesco.org/s/LjHcoC7D7L5rAsn)|Some of the variables included were randomly generated by IIEP for the purpose of this exercise|

The school layer includes information on a number of variables, some of which are based on ficticious data. More information on this can be found on the attribute table "Variable dictionary - School location", saved directly on the GeoPackage.

🧐 The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) is an alliance of 11 states located in a geographical area prone to tropical storms, volcanic eruptions and other natural hazards related to climate change. It is therefore important for local and regional authorities to be able to rapidly locate schools and to be able to assess whether schools are damaged by different hazards.

🎯 The aim of the challenge is to create a digital platform to help communities locate the nearest schools in their districts and, in case of an emergency, to identify community facilities that can provide shelter or first aid kits.

⛑ To prepare for this challenge, we are looking for people who are comfortable with web development, geolocation and creating optimised routes.
